So, partly FYI, these are the species codes that currently occur
in the PTAGIS database:

Species Code / Species Name
  / Unknown
0 / Unknown
1 / Chinook
2 / Coho
3 / Steelhead
4 / Sockeye
5 / Chum
6 / Pink
7 / Bull Trout
8 / Cutthroat Trout
9 / Other
A / Pcific Lamprey
B / WHite Sturgeon
C / Green Sturgeon
D / Nothern Pikeminnow
E / Brook Trout
F / American Shad
g / Mountain Whitefish
H / Walleye
I / Channel Catfish
J / Smallmouth Bass
K / Western Brook Lamprey
L / Lamprey (species unknown)


These run codes occur:

Run Code / Run Name
0 / NA
1 / Spring
2 / Summer
3 / Fall
4 / Winter
5 / Unknown
9 / 
R / Resident


And these rear-type codes:

Rear-Type Code / Rear-Type Name
  / Unknown
G / 
H / Hatchery Reared
M / 
O / 
U / Unknown
W / Wild Fish or Natural Production

I have no idea what would be meant by Rear-Type 9, M, or O, but there are very
very few fish ever with those Rear Type codes.

--------------------------------------------------

So "A" should never occur for Run or Rear Type.  But just in case they ever
establish a new "A" Run or "A" Rear Type code, we should make sure the capthist
code distinguishes between "A" and "All".

----
Some more FYI stuff:

* I was not even aware that capthist would accept --Species=All.  We (almost?)
always run it with a Species Code specified.  However, the project I was
working on that led me to turn up the "1 vs A" issue could conceivably 
lead me to try some --Species=All runs.

* Almost all fish have Rear Type = H, U, or W.  We usually run capthist with
--rearType=H, W, or All.

* Regarding Run, we almost always use --Run=All.  However, this is possible
because our usual pre-capthist processing of data results in input files for
which we want to use some Run(s), but eliminate others.  Technically, because
of the biology of the various Runs, I could imagine a situation where an input
file had Runs 1, 2, and 3, and we wanted 3 to be "Wrong Run" error, but allow
1 and 2.  I doubt we have that option now (and if we do, I don't know what the
setting of --Run would be; I doubt "--Run=12" would work). But I am not going
to request that functionality at this time, so the status quo for Run is fine.
