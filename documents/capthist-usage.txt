Capthist usage:

The program is configured by use of program arguments given either on the
command line or in a run configuration file. Arguments on the command line
have precedence over those in the run configuration file. The run
configuration file by default is "settings.xml", but can be specified using
the "rcFileName" flag (see below).

Program arguments are key words followed by two dashes ('-'). Arguments which
take a value are followed by an equals sign ('=') and the value. For instance:

        capthist --rcFileName=example.xml

Arguments that are either true or false can be specified without an argument,
implying "true", or with the value stated explicitly:

        capthist --warnings --removeJacks=false ...

Following is a list of the program arguments and their usage:
